I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Lincoln, affiliated with the [AgriFoRwArdS CDT](https://agriforwards-cdt.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/). My research lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence, applied to intelligent robotic perception, autonomous control, manipulation, and interaction.

My PhD research focuses on image-based insect counting in water traps, primarily addressing the challenges of detecting and counting small, crowded, and occluded insects using deep learning, counting reliability assessment and interactive robotic stirring, under the supervision of [Prof. Grzegorz Cielniak](https://staff.lincoln.ac.uk/e69a17de-0ef1-4771-8004-646967ea1ac9). Previously, I completed an MSc in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at the University of Lincoln in 2022, as part of the AgriFoRwArdS Doctoral Training programme. And I earned an MEng in Mechanical Engineering at Wuhan University of Science and Technology in 2019, where I was affiliated with [the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems](https://iris.wust.edu.cn/index.htm) and my research focused on local structured environment perception and object detection for indoor mobile robots under the supervision of [Prof. Jiang Lin](https://jxzdh.wust.edu.cn/info/1472/38392.htm). In addition, I have industry experience as an AI Algorithm Engineer at Beijing Mcfly Technology Co. Ltd, where I worked on the development of a weeding robot, weed monitoring using UAV imagery, and farmland monitoring based on satellite imagery. I also had a short-term internship and work experience at an autonomous driving company, where I focused on vehicle recognition and 3D reconstruction.
