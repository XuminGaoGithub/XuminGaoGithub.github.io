<h2>A Dancing Robot</h2>
<p style="margin-top:5px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; text-align-last: left;">
In this work, a robot capable of speaking, singing, and dancing was designed and implemented. Specifically, A humanoid robot was assembled using various aluminum alloy structural components, including U-shaped brackets, L-shaped brackets, and multifunctional brackets, together with eight MG995R servo motors, enabling basic degrees of freedom for the robot’s upper limbs, lower limbs, and torso. In terms of control, a 32-channel servo controller was selected as the main motion control unit. Precise control of servo angles and motion timing was achieved through PWM signals, and multiple sets of dance motion commands were preprogrammed and stored, allowing the robot to perform actions such as arm waving, walking, waist twisting, sliding steps, and rotation. The speech recognition subsystem employs a YS-V0.5 voice recognition module, which outputs corresponding high- or low-level I/O signals upon recognizing predefined voice commands. A relay is used to control the power supply of the servo control system and the music playback module. When a start command is recognized, the relay is activated, and the robot automatically begins executing dance motions while playing music; when a stop command is recognized, the relay is deactivated, and both motion and music playback are terminated. The music subsystem uses a BYS200-U audio module to provide dance accompaniment. Ultimately, a dance robot system integrating motion control, speech interaction, and music playback was successfully realized.
