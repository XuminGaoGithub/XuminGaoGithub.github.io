Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have constraints on battery life that affect their
time-of-flight. This is especially important for coverage applications in forests,
where a drone might not be recoverable from failure. In this work, we developed
and implemented a planning strategy for UAVs to plan an emergency landing on one
of landing zones in an environment which will maximize coverage within battery
life constraints.

<p style="margin-top:5px; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
We proposed a system consisting of two planners: a coverage planner and an emergency
planner, integrated within a behavior executive that intelligently switches modes
based on the UAV’s remaining battery life. The landing planner was based on a 3D A*
algorithm that also considered covered area as part of the cost function. Code available on
